  <!-- My Story Section -->
        <h2 class="subtitle">My Story</h2>
        <p>Selling has been at the core of most jobs I've had as an adult. I’ve been selling software since 2016 and worked as a music agent before that.</p>
        <p>After attending Drumtech in London (before it became BIMM) and touring as a musician, I discovered the importance of broadening my skillset in the pursuit of a rewarding and sustainable career. I co-founded a booking agency in Manchester in 2010 before joining major London agency X-ray Touring in 2012, where I remained for the best part of five years.</p>
        <p>I left London in 2016 and moved to Barcelona. I entered into IT business development and sales as a new career - one which I had never before considered a likely path for myself. It’s turned out to be an amazing experience and the IT and sales training I have participated in - and the client-facing role of Account Management - have allowed me to acquire and develop vital business and personal skills.</p>
        <p>Since October 2018 I have also been writing a book which I am currently preparing for release a little later this year. In addition to this I have been studying front end web development since August 2019 and I have been working on my own author website as well as developing a personal portfolio of websites as part of the fantastic Treehouse training framework.</p>
